           <b> Research and Scholarship:</b></br>
A vibrant academic community is characterized by ongoing research and scholarly activities.
 Faculty members contribute significantly to the body of knowledge in their respective fields through research, publications, and participation in academic conferences.
 This commitment to scholarship not only enhances the faculty's expertise but also enriches the educational experience for students.

            <h3>Improving Equity in AP Computer Science Principles: Scaling Beauty and Joy of Computing</h3>
            <p><b>Principal Investigator:</b> Dr. John Doe</p>
            <p><b>Description:</b>This project will support implementation and study of the Beauty and Joy of Computing (BJC) curriculum. We aim to increase implementation of BJC in African states and beyond particularly in high-need districts. We will study the effects of BJC implementation on the participation of girls, Black, Latinx and low-income students. .</p>

            <h3>Web Evolution and Emerging Threats</h3>
            <p><b>Principal Investigator:</b> Dr. Jane Smith</p>
            <p><b>Description:</b> We study the web differently from how users explore it, as browsers are not meant to be monitoring tools. 
                Researchers build either ad-hoc solutions or use high-level information from the browser that is inadequate to identify some of the most advanced web attacks.
                 This research aims at building the fundamental blocks for studying an increasingly complex web by developing a monitoring platform that sheds light into the inner workings of modern browsers and websites. Our research outcomes will allow any researcher, web developer or web user to understand better how the web works..</p>
